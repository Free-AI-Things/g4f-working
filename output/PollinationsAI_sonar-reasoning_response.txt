The user is asking if I'm working and asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

This is a simple, direct query. The user is checking if I'm functional and can respond to them.

Looking at the search results provided - they're all about AI assistants' capabilities in customer service, response times, and features. None of these search results are relevant to answering whether I'm working or functional.

Since the search results aren't relevant to this query, I should simply answer the user's question directly. They're asking if I'm working - and yes, I am. I can respond to them.

I don't need to cite search results here
